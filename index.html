        <img src="img/aikidoPlate (1).png" alt="Aikido plate image 2" id="double">
        <p>This is one of the first things I made in ceramics class. It is a plate with the Suenaka/Suenaga family crest in the center. Roy Suenaka cerated a style of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJleul97SMAxXJh1YBHZ58LD4QFnoECDQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.villaricaaikido.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw0wzNRiMFH0rLy4pqUy8fct&opi=89978449" target="_blank">Aikido</a> called 'Suenaka Ha Tetsugaku Ho Aikido' I study this martial art, and made this as a house warming gift for one of my Shihans(Master Instructor).

        <h4>niter container</h4>
        <img src="img/box 1.jpg" alt=" box 1 image">
        <p>This is a container I made to store some niter/saltpetre/potassium nitrate. It is glazed with a 'Poo Bear'  glaze as a base, and 'Tuxedo' black glaze for the symbol, both are Stroke&Coat brand glaze.</p>

        <div class="container">
        <h4>charcoal container</h4>
        <img src="img/Box2.jpg" alt="Box 2 image">
        <p>This is not entirely my project. A friend made it but when it was fired some other unglazed piece exploded and got shraptnil stuck to it, so she gave it to me. I sanded and filed down the shraptnil and glazed over it with 'Tuxedo' black from Stroke&coat. Then I put the symbol for charcoal compound on the sides of it with 'Cotton Tail' White glaze also Stroke&coat brand. I intend on using this container to store charcoal compound in it.</p>

        <div class="container">
        <h4>horn</h4>
        <img src="img/Horn.jpg" alt="Unicorn Horn Plate">
        <p>This is a plate I made as a decoration to be attached to my appothacary cabnet. It is a unicorn horn it represent s an appothacary work and expertiese because of the myth that a unicorn can heal any injury even death. Unfortionaly it warped during drying, and even more while being fired in the kiln. I Glazed it with the 'Obsidian' Jungle Gem glaze and filled in the symbol with a gold NEWELL brand paint pen.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Pumpkin</h4>
        <img src="img/pumpkin.jpg" alt="Pumpkin Sculpture">
        <p>This is a piece I made while at EK's Art Barn. It's a pumpkin that I spent a okay amount of effort and time into. The back of it exploded and the stem came off while firing. I glued the stem back together and reattached it, but sa for the back side there is nothing I can do to fix it. The kind folks at EK's Art Barn glazed it for me, so I dont know exaxtly what glaze they used. </p>

I made it to collect the water that comes out of the botton of a pot with a christmas cactus in it. I formed the lip without a mold, I waited until it was leather hard then pinched and bent the edge.

        <p>This is a container I made to store some Aqua Tofana/Arsenic Trioxide. It is made with a coil technique and then covered up with some more clay. The lid had to be made twice because the first one didn't fit. The inside is glazed with a mixture of "Candy Apple' red and 'Tuxedo' black, the outside is just 'Tuxedo' black. the symbol on the lid is done with a gold paint pen from NEWELL, and then covered up with clear glue to seal it and pervent the gold from wairing off.</p>

            <li style="margin-top: 10px;">In alchemy, "tria prima" refers to the three fundamental principles or "primes" - sulfur, mercury, and salt - believed to be the building blocks of all matter and the basis of alchemical transformation. </li>
            <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Soul Sulfur (or Spiritus): Represents the principle of combustibility, often associated with the soul or consciousness. </li>
            <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Mind Mercury (or Anima): Represents the principle of fusibility and volatility, often associated with the spirit or mind. </li>

        <p>I am proud of this item I have made it took a few days of strugling to make it, but in the end I feel like it turned out all right.

            <li style="margin-top: 25px;">Air: In alchemy, air represents a life-giving force which we associate with the colours white & blue.

            <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Fire: In alchemy, fire represents emotions such as passion, love, anger, and hate, which are sometimes referred to as “fiery” emotions. Aristotle labeled it as hot and dry, and it is represented by the colours red and orange, as well as the humor yellow bile. Additionally, fire is also seen as a more masculine symbol.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Earth: In alchemy, earth was believed to be primarily dry, and secondarily cold, (as per Aristotle).

        <img src="img/steiza (1).jpg" alt="man in steiza 2" id="double">
        <p>I had a the idea to make this figurine on a friday, I made it the following monday. I am honstly suprised I remembered it. The figurine is made to represent my self back when I was training; faceless, battered, injured, and broken, but still maintaining focus and form. There is a song <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi33Jmm2bSMAxVUrlYBHZmFHo0Q78AJegQIERAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9OFpfTd0EIs&usg=AOvVaw3hvu9y7K009NMo6lbOFETa&opi=89978449" target="_blank">"Eyes Without a Face"</a> by Billy Idol, sums up how I was "living". The figureene has cuts and scars covering the body. It is sitting in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjC5a-r4bSMAxXdQjABHWwgAC8QFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSeiza&usg=AOvVaw1K-vFnHvymouugcDdYwe3B&opi=89978449" target="_blank">seiza</a>. The face has only eyes to represent  the selflessness in which we were trained into. I used 'Ruby Slippers' red by Scroke&Coat for the cuts.</p>

        <p>I had the idea on the same friday I came up with the figureene, except I didn't make it until thursday. I shaped it  and then hollowed it with a loop tool. After that I attached some branches then fired it. one of the branches fell off in the kiln. I glazed it with every brown glaze I owned by Stroke&Coat. I then mad10000000.302.0e a guy to hang from one of the branches. I tied hum up in a noose I made out of twine.</p>
